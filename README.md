# python-AI-audio-utility

## Basic usage

To use this code, first make sure that you are using `python3` and have an OpenAi API key.

Create two repositories, one called `translations`, for the translated text (wich is going to be in english). And another one called `transcriptions`.

Now run `python3 main.py "file_path" "file_name" "open_ai_key"`.
